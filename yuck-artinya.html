They lived in a palace. Prince Raden Putra's father was the king of the kingdom.One day, Dewi Limaran was walking around in the palace garden. Suddenly she saw a snail. It was ugly and disgusting. "Yuck!" said Dewi Limaran and then she threw it away into a river. She did not know that the snail was actually an old and powerful witch. She could transform herself into anything. The witch was angry to Dewi Limaran. The witch put a spell on her and changed her into a golden snail. The witch then threw it away into the river.The golden snail was drifting away in the river and got caught into a net. An old woman was fishing and used her net to catch some fish. She was surprised to see a golden snail in her net. She took it and brought it home. When the old woman woke up in the morning, she was surprised that the house was in the good condition. The floor was mopped. And she also had food on the table. She was thinking very hard. "Who did this to me? The person is very kind." It happened again and again every morning.The old woman was very curious. One night she decided to stay up late. She was peeping from her room to know who cooked for her. Then, she could not believe what she saw. The golden snail she caught in the river turned into a beautiful woman. The old woman approached her. "Who are you, young girl?" "I am Dewi Limaran, Ma'am. A witch cursed me. I can change back as a human only at night," explained Dewi Limaran. "The spell can be broken if I hear the melody from the holy gamelan," continued Dewi Limaran. The old woman then rushed to the palace. She talked to Prince Raden Putra about her wife. Prince Raden Putra was so happy. He had been looking for his wife everywhere.He then prayed and meditated. He asked the gods to give him the holy gamelan. He wanted to break the witch's spell. After several days praying and meditating, finally gods granted his wish. He immediately brought the holy gamelan to the old woman's house. He played it beautifully. And then amazingly the golden snail turned into the beautiful Dewi Limaran. The couple was so happy that they could be together again. They also thanked the old woman for her kindness. As a return, they asked her to stay in the palace.</a>

Ungrateful Son
Anak yang Tidak Berterima Kasih &gt;&gt; Edisi Bahasa Indonesia
A Folktale from East Java
JATUR and Menur are twins. Jantur is a boy and Menur is a girl. Jantur and Menur are very different. Jantur is lazy and gets angry easily. When Jantur is angry, he always says bad things. On the other hand, Menur is kind, diligent, and patient girl.
When their parents are working in a paddy field, Jantur ask Menur to cook. He is hungry. Menur then cooks for her brother. After the food is served, Jantur eats. Suddenly he throws the food on the floor. 
“What food is this? Yuck! It’s not delicious!”
Menur cries. She is very sad. But she is not angry to her brother. Slowly she collects the food on the floor and put it in the trash bin.
When their parents return home, Menur tells about the food. 
The father advises Jantur, “Why did you do that to your sister? She already helped you.”
Jantur is angry, “I don’t care! Her food is not delicious! I hate her.”
“Lease don’t say that. She is your sister, “ father tries to calm him down.
“Why did you defend her? Why didn’t you support me? If you don’t love me anymore, go away! I hate you all!”
Jantur is very angry. He cannot control himself. Menur and her parents then leave the house. They now stay in a mountain. Everyday they pray to God to make Jantur becomes a good person.
Not long after that, Jantur suffers a disease. His body is full of tumors. It’s very bad. Nobody wants to see him. He looks very ugly. Jantur realizes that God punishes him. He regrets. Then he leaves his house to look for his parents and his sister.
Finally he finds them. He asks for their forgiveness. 
“I’m sorry, Mom and Dad. I’m sorry Menur. I have done bad things to you all. Now please forgive me,” Jantur says.
“We all already forgave you, Son. Everyday we pray for you. Now God hears our pray. Come here…” Mom then hugs Jantur.
Suddenly all the tumors in Jantur’s body are gone! Jantur is very happy.

PRINCE Raden Putra and Dewi Limaran were husband and wife. They lived in a palace. The Prince Raden Putra's father was the king of the kingdom.
One day, Dewi Limaran was walking around in the palace garden. Suddenly she saw a snail. It was ugly and disgusting.
"Yuck!" said Dewi Limaran and then she threw it away into a river.
She did not know that the snail was actually an old and powerful witch. She could transform herself into anything. The witch was angry to Dewi Limaran. The witch put a spell on her and changed her into a golden snail. The witch then threw it away into the river.
The golden snail was drifting away in the river and got caught in a net. An old woman was fishing and used her net to catch some fish. She was surprised to see a golden snail in her net. She took it and brought it home. When the old woman woke up in the morning, she was surprised that the house was in better condition. The floor was mopped. And she also had food on the table. She was thinking very hard.
"Who did this to me? The person is very kind." It happened again and again every morning.
The old woman was very curious. One night she decided to stay up late. She was peeping from her room to know who cooked for her. Then, she could not believe what she saw. The golden snail she caught in the river turned into a beautiful woman. The old woman approached her.
"Who are you, young girl?"
"I am Dewi Limaran, Ma'am. A witch cursed me. I can change back as a human only at night," explained Dewi Limaran.
"The spell can be broken if I hear the melody from the holy Gamelan," continued Dewi Limaran.
The old woman then rushed to the palace. She talked to Prince Raden Putra about her wife.
Prince Raden Putra was so happy. He had been looking for his wife everywhere.
He then prayed and meditated. He asked the gods to give him the holy Gamelan. He wanted to break the witch's spell. After several days praying and meditating, finally gods granted his wish. He immediately brought the holy Gamelan to the old woman's house. He played it beautifully. And then amazingly the golden snail turned into the beautiful Dewi Limaran.
The couple was so happy that they could be together again. They also thanked the old woman for her kindness. As a return, they asked her to stay in the palace

"Yuck!" said Dewi Limaran and then she threw it away into a river. She did not know that the snail was actually an old and powerful witch. She could transform herself into anything. The witch was angry to Dewi Limaran. The witch put a spell on her and changed her into a golden snail. The witch then threw it away into the river.The golden snail was drifting away in the river and got caught into a net. An old woman was fishing and used her net to catch some fish. She was surprised to see a golden snail in her net. She took it and brought it home. When the old woman woke up in the morning, she was surprised that the house was in the good condition. The floor was mopped. And she also had food on the table. She was thinking very hard. "Who did this to me? The person is very kind." It happened again and again every morning.The old woman was very curious. One night she decided to stay up late. She was peeping from her room to know who cooked for her. Then, she could not believe what she saw. The golden snail she caught in the river turned into a beautiful woman. The old woman approached her. "Who are you, young girl?" "I am Dewi Limaran, Ma'am. A witch cursed me. I can change back as a human only at night," explained Dewi Limaran. "The spell can be broken if I hear the melody from the holy gamelan," continued Dewi Limaran. The old woman then rushed to the palace. She talked to Prince Raden Putra about her wife. Prince Raden Putra was so happy. He had been looking for his wife everywhere.He then prayed and meditated. He asked the gods to give him the holy gamelan. He wanted to break the witch's spell. After several days praying and meditating, finally gods granted his wish. He immediately brought the holy gamelan to the old woman's house. He played it beautifully. And then amazingly the golden snail turned into the beautiful Dewi Limaran. The couple was so happy that they could be together again. They also thanked the old woman for her kindness. As a return, they asked her to stay in the palace.</h2><br />

 live a widow with her two beautiful daughters, Bawang Merah (Red Onion)
 and Bawang Putih (White Garlic). Bawang Putih's real father which was 
also the widows's husband died long ago. Bawang Merah and  Bawang Putih 
had opposite characters and personalities. Bawang Putih was diligent, 
kind, honest and humble girl. Meanwhile, Bawang merah was lazy, 
glamorous, proud and envious girl.<br /><br />compli : One day, Bawang Putih was doing her step-mother
 and sister's laundry. Bawang Putih didn't realize it when a piece of 
cloth belonged to her mother was washed away by the river. How sad was 
she, thinking that if the cloth couldn't be found she would be blamed, 
and it wasn't impossible that she would bu punished and expelled from 
home. Being afraid that her mother cloth could not be found, Bawang 
Putih kept looking and walked along the river with its strong current<br /><br />resolution
 :  Every time she saw someone by the river, she always asked him or her
 about her mother's cloth which was washed away by the river, but 
everyone didn't know where the cloth was. Eventually Bawang Putih came 
to a place where the river flowed into a cave. Surprisingly, there was a very old woman
 in the cave. Bawang Putih  asked the old woman if she knew of the cloth
 whereabouts. The woman knew where the cloth was, but she made a 
condition before she handed it to Bawang Putih. The condition was that 
she had to work assisting the old woman. Bawang Putih was used to 
working hard so that her work pleased the old woman. It was late 
afternoon and Bawang Putih was saying goodbye to the old woman. The 
woman handed the cloth to her. because of her kindness, the old woman 
offered her a gift of pumpkins. There were two of them, one was larger 
than the other. Bawang Putih was asked to choose the gift she wanted. 
She wasn't greedy, there she chose the smaller one<br /><br />reorientation :
 Returning home, the Step-Mother and Bawang Merah were furious because 
Bawang Putih was late. She told them what happened from the time her 
mother's cloth was washed away until her encounter with the old woman in
 the cave. Her step-mother was still furious because she was already 
late and only brought one small pumkin, so the mother smashed the 
pumpkin to the ground. "Whack..." and the pumpkin was broken, but it was
 miraculous that in the pumpkin  there were beautiful golden, jewel, and
 diamond ornaments. The Widow and Bawang Merah were very schocked. They 
could get very rich with that much jewelry.
 But greedy they were, they yelled at Bawang Putih asking why she didn't
 take the large pumkin instead. In the Widow and Bawang Merah's minds, 
if the larger pumpkin was taken, they should get much more jewelry. 
 Fulfilling their greed, Bawang Merah folowed the steps told by Bawang 
Putih. She wilingly drifted her mother's cloth, walked along the river, 
asked people and eventually came to the cave where the old woman lived. 
Unlike Bawang Putih, however, bawang Merah refused the old woman's order
 to work and She even arrogantly ordered the old woman to give her the 
larger pumpkin. And so the old woman gave it to Bawang Merah. Bawang 
Merah happily brought the pumpkin that the old woman gave, while 
imagining how much jewelry she would get. Returning home, the Widow 
welcomed her beloved daughter. Not waiting for long, the pumpkin was 
smashed to the ground, "whack ..." but instead of the jewelry, appeared 
various terrifying snakes. The Widow and Bawang Merah finally realized 
what they did all this time was wrong and asked Bawang Putih to forgive 
them.<br /><br /><br />

Ungrateful Son
Anak yang Tidak Berterima Kasih &gt;&gt; Edisi Bahasa Indonesia
A Folktale from East Java
JATUR and Menur are twins. Jantur is a boy and Menur is a girl. Jantur and Menur are very different. Jantur is lazy and gets angry easily. When Jantur is angry, he always says bad things. On the other hand, Menur is kind, diligent, and patient girl.
When their parents are working in a paddy field, Jantur ask Menur to cook. He is hungry. Menur then cooks for her brother. After the food is served, Jantur eats. Suddenly he throws the food on the floor. 
“What food is this? Yuck! It’s not delicious!”
Menur cries. She is very sad. But she is not angry to her brother. Slowly she collects the food on the floor and put it in the trash bin.
When their parents return home, Menur tells about the food. 
The father advises Jantur, “Why did you do that to your sister? She already helped you.”
Jantur is angry, “I don’t care! Her food is not delicious! I hate her.”
“Lease don’t say that. She is your sister, “ father tries to calm him down.
“Why did you defend her? Why didn’t you support me? If you don’t love me anymore, go away! I hate you all!”
Jantur is very angry. He cannot control himself. Menur and her parents then leave the house. They now stay in a mountain. Everyday they pray to God to make Jantur becomes a good person.
Not long after that, Jantur suffers a disease. His body is full of tumors. It’s very bad. Nobody wants to see him. He looks very ugly. Jantur realizes that God punishes him. He regrets. Then he leaves his house to look for his parents and his sister.
Finally he finds them. He asks for their forgiveness. 
“I’m sorry, Mom and Dad. I’m sorry Menur. I have done bad things to you all. Now please forgive me,” Jantur says.
“We all already forgave you, Son. Everyday we pray for you. Now God hears our pray. Come here…” Mom then hugs Jantur.
Suddenly all the tumors in Jantur’s body are gone! Jantur is very happy.

                            20.                    keong mas ( the golden snail)
PRINCE Raden Putra and Dewi Limaran were husband and wife. They lived in a palace. The Prince Raden Putra's father was the king of the kingdom.
One day, Dewi Limaran was walking around in the palace garden. Suddenly she saw a snail. It was ugly and disgusting.
"Yuck!" said Dewi Limaran and then she threw it away into a river.
She did not know that the snail was actually an old and powerful witch. She could transform herself into anything. The witch was angry to Dewi Limaran. The witch put a spell on her and changed her into a golden snail. The witch then threw it away into the river.
The golden snail was drifting away in the river and got caught in a net. An old woman was fishing and used her net to catch some fish. She was surprised to see a golden snail in her net. She took it and brought it home. When the old woman woke up in the morning, she was surprised that the house was in better condition. The floor was mopped. And she also had food on the table. She was thinking very hard.
"Who did this to me? The person is very kind." It happened again and again every morning.
The old woman was very curious. One night she decided to stay up late. She was peeping from her room to know who cooked for her. Then, she could not believe what she saw. The golden snail she caught in the river turned into a beautiful woman. The old woman approached her.
"Who are you, young girl?"
"I am Dewi Limaran, Ma'am. A witch cursed me. I can change back as a human only at night," explained Dewi Limaran.
"The spell can be broken if I hear the melody from the holy Gamelan," continued Dewi Limaran.
The old woman then rushed to the palace. She talked to Prince Raden Putra about her wife.
Prince Raden Putra was so happy. He had been looking for his wife everywhere.
He then prayed and meditated. He asked the gods to give him the holy Gamelan. He wanted to break the witch's spell. After several days praying and meditating, finally gods granted his wish. He immediately brought the holy Gamelan to the old woman's house. He played it beautifully. And then amazingly the golden snail turned into the beautiful Dewi Limaran.
The couple was so happy that they could be together again. They also thanked the old woman for her kindness. As a return, they asked her to stay in the palace
