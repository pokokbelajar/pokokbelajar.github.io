Woman : Well, I’ve been quite busy these days. I got a new job. I still need to adjust to everything here.
Man : What’s the weather like in Seattle these days? Has it been cloudy, windy, or humid?
Woman : Well, it’s summer, so it’s quite hot here. You don’t like hot weather, do you?
Man : Well, I prefer rainy days. You know, those days with hurricanes. I don’t like the sunshine. It is so nice when the sky is overcast. I don’t see the beauty in a rainbow.
Woman : You are an odd fellow. Summer is so much fun. I mean, going to the beach, getting tanned and sunbathing. Those activities are incredibly enjoyable. I wonder why you hate summer.
Man : Hmm. Let’s just say I don’t want to experience heatstroke. </a>

Pipiku cekung dan berubah menjadi merah saat aku tertawa. Bibirku kecil dan bibirku gigi berwarna putih. Tinggi saya 175 cm dan berat saya 60 cm.
