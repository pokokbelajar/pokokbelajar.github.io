                                            Most large companies do not know how to
make the best use of clever people. Employees who
criticize the old ways of doing things and want to try
out new ideas are disliked both by their colleagues and
by their bosses Comments like 'They wouldn't listen to
me' or 'I kept presenting new product ideas, only to
hear nothing' are typical of many a manager who
become an entrepreneur. All of this causes frustration,
which can quickly lead t boredom. Often, middle
managers start to think; 'Only another 30 more years of
working may way to retirement At this point, they want
to find a way out.
They need to get away from a job that is no
longer attractive. So they decide to set up on their own.
But the need something else, too: the challenge of
taking risks. They are like people who climb a
mountain by the most dangerous route. Entrepreneurial
types need to try out new things without knowing
whether they will succeed o fail. They also want to
prove that they can make it without big company
support.
As well as motivation, most successful
entrepreneurs have a number of personal
characteristics in common The first is self-confidence,
the feeling of certainty that you have got the skills,
knowledge and energy to build u; your own business.
There is also stubbornness, the determination to prove
to the boss who rejected your ideas the they were good
ideas which can*be made to work. Possessing this
quality means that you won't give up: you have to
make your ideas work.

The earthworm eats its way through.
By burrowing into the soil, the earthworm creates channels and pockets into which air can enter. This allows the soil to become oxygenated so that plant roots can breathe. In this way, earthworms act as gardeners and cultivators of the soil.

Mainframe computers are very large computers that are stacked up on frames. They usually have many inputs and output terminal such as keyboard and monitor. They are sometime stacked up in the middle of room although they are generally stacked up against the walls of a room. Micro computers are the most common type of computers. These computers run on a micro-chip. They can only hold one input and output terminal plus a printer. Mini computers run on mini-chip. They can do a lot of things that a micro computer can't. For instance they can support many input and output terminals. They are also a lot of faster than a micro computer.Ka Tolong Tentukan General Classification and The Description ​</a>

                            16. Most large companies do not know how to
make the best use of clever people. Employees who
criticize the old ways of doing things and want to try
out new ideas are disliked both by their colleagues and
by their bosses Comments like 'They wouldn't listen to
me' or 'I kept presenting new product ideas, only to
hear nothing' are typical of many a manager who
become an entrepreneur. All of this causes frustration,
which can quickly lead t boredom. Often, middle
managers start to think; 'Only another 30 more years of
working may way to retirement At this point, they want
to find a way out.
They need to get away from a job that is no
longer attractive. So they decide to set up on their own.
But the need something else, too: the challenge of
taking risks. They are like people who climb a
mountain by the most dangerous route. Entrepreneurial
types need to try out new things without knowing
whether they will succeed o fail. They also want to
prove that they can make it without big company
support.
As well as motivation, most successful
entrepreneurs have a number of personal
characteristics in common The first is self-confidence,
the feeling of certainty that you have got the skills,
knowledge and energy to build u; your own business.
There is also stubbornness, the determination to prove
to the boss who rejected your ideas the they were good
ideas which can*be made to work. Possessing this
quality means that you won't give up: you have to
make your ideas work.

The earthworm can do this because its body has many narrow rings joined together by a softer material that enables it to change shape. Whenever the soil is too hard to be pushed aside. The earthworm eats its way through.
By burrowing into the soil, the earthworm creates channels and pockets into which air can enter. This allows the soil to become oxygenated so that plant roots can breathe. In this way, earthworms act as gardeners and cultivators of the soil.

Seeing the clear and cool water of the river, my friends and I decided to swim. After having lunch together, we went around the area to enjoy the scenery. We saw some beautiful birds and butterflies.After walking about an hour, we decided to return to the car and go home. Unfortunately, we could not start up the car.
