                                            Valentine's DayOne evening in February, Grandpa Grizzly came to visit. He shook the snow off his fur coat and sat by the fire.“A story, a story! Tell us a story!” cried the Hoppers. “Come sit before me,” said Grandpa Grizzly. “Do you know what holiday is coming?”The Hoppers sat and thought. What day was coming?“Don’t you know what comes on the fourteenth of February?” asked Grandpa Grizzly. The Hoppers thought as hard as they could. They could not remember.“Perhaps there is a surprise in my suitcase to help you remember. Do you have any idea?” asked Grandpa Grizzly.“No, no, we haven’t!” the Hoppers cried.“Then I’m afraid you must wait until tomorrow morning before you get your surprise. Do not sleep late!”The Hoppers laughed and promised to wake up early. They wondered all night what the surprise might be—all except Snubby Nose. He remembered what day was coming. He slept soundly the whole night.Speedy Legs, Fluffy Tail, and Floppy Ears woke up early the next morning. They went on tiptoe intoGrandpa Grizzly’s room and woke him up.“Open the suitcase, and see your surprises,” Grandpa Grizzly said.Speedy Legs looked inside and found a little bow and arrow. Fluffy Tail looked inside and found a little pair of wings. Floppy Ears took out a big box of chocolates. These all came from Cupid, because, of course, it was Valentine’s Day.“Valentine’s Day!” the Hoppers cried. But there was no Snubby Nose to find his present.“Where is Snubby Nose?” asked Grandpa Grizzly.They looked everywhere, but Snubby Nose was gone. They ate their breakfasts, and still Snubby Nose did not come. They ate their lunches, and still Snubby Nose did not come.“Open the suitcase, and see your surprises,” Grandpa Grizzly said. Speedy Legs looked inside and found a little bow and arrow. Fluffy Tail looked inside and found a little pair of wings. Floppy Ears took out a big box of chocolates. These all came from Cupid, because, of course, it was Valentine’s Day. “Valentine’s Day!” the Hoppers cried. But there was no Snubby Nose to find his present.“Where is Snubby Nose?” asked Grandpa Grizzly.They looked everywhere, but Snubby Nose was gone. They ate their breakfasts, and still Snubby Nose did not come. They ate their lunches, and still Snubby Nose did not come.Finally, Mother Hopper said, “We should go to town and look for Snubby Nose.”Grandpa Grizzly waited by the fire, in case Snubby Nose came home. The Hoppers took their wings and their chocolates and their bow and arrows and marched down the road. They were a great sight!Soon, they heard the patter of little feet running toward them. Snubby Nose came around the corner. He had a red paper heart under his arm. “I remember what comes on the fourteenth of February! It is Valentine’s Day. I made a valentine for Grandpa Grizzly.”All this time, Grandpa Grizzly waited at home. “While the Hoppers are out, I’ll make them some valentine cookies,” he said.He made some lovely cookies. He cut them in the shape of hearts and sprinkled red sugar on them. Just as he took the last pan from the oven, Snubby Nose rushed in.“The fourteenth of February is Valentine’s Day!” he said. “And I have made you a valentine.” Grandpa Grizzly was very pleased. He opened Snubby Nose’s valentine and read it to the Hoppers. “Please accept this heart of mine. I am your loving valentine.” Grandpa Grizzly was so pleased, he gave Snubby Nose the largest cookie of all.Question: What is about?

Chicken Soup For The Soul

thanks to CF
Attitude is a little thing that will lead to major changes.
-Winston Churchill -
 	One call to the panic of the first when the young doctor told us that the baby male - our new nine month old suffering from cystic fibrosis is, "Oh God, my baby will die." Indeed, that's all I could think about for days - day and weeks - weeks (maybe even months - months) first unclear. My baby will not survive. My baby will not survive. My baby ....
 	And then he became not a baby anymore. He has become like any other toddler. He shouted "No, no, no" with all his strength. He swallowed his apple sauce already mixed with the medicine. He watched Little Bear of the DVD during therapy sessions three times a day (patting his chest and then re-emit thick sputum for cough - cough). He ran from me while naked and pee on the floor. He sometimes - sometimes had to be hospitalized and intravenously. He's adorable. He was naughty. He did need extra care to stay healthy, but certainly he will not survive.
 	Repeatedly in the hospital for many - years must hinder the development - developments in the growth mentioned by experts to scare - scare inexperienced parents; They also mentioned the importance of a variety of other developments, which are much more complex to achieve child in size - the size except the things - important things for a pleasant life. My son is already manifest desire to run, who cares about when it's time? He was also a fighter and powerful. He also obtained his black belt, memangnya important to me when a child - another kid got it early? Achievement - indeed overdue achievement than children - other children, but he kept trying. He was able to play his cards well, as we all do. I must admit that the parents of children - children who get chronic diseases feeling - a feeling of excessive pride and shame for the victory - kemenanangan child. They are much sweeter. Higher value. Achievement, I think, should be measured as well in terms of depth and height. Thanks to the CF.
 	Slowly - land, after many - years, how - our view is changing.
 	Sessions - therapy sessions lungs - lungs, which originally was pleasan burdensome, has now formed a closeness between us that was until now. High nutritional standards, which once seemed as stress, has forced me to do some research and hone skills kulinerku. Logistics deadlock due to enter hospital, which originally was confusing has created a certain level of comfort in such situations. Anxiety - anxiety that is inevitable, such as depression, requires us to discuss the topic - the topic that weight. With this wisdom appreciate the variety of our family so much more alive, ranging from cooking better and stronger body to the conversation more excited and more relaxed lifestyle. We have children - other children and more to spend on ice cream. We dig deeper faith, seek - find strength and find purpose, and comfort more meaningful. Are we becoming more grieving? Certainly. However, we become wiser and more understanding. Thanks to the CF.
 	Are we becoming more grieving? Certainly. However, we become wiser and more understanding. Thanks to the CF.
 	What does it mean we just run the wisdom and everything was sorted out by itself? We wrote a letter - a letter to appeal for research funding; we work as a volunteer in various fund-raising events; we also signed and follow the demo studies and surveys; and we talk in public. There we know more and some that we know a little more. In certain cases, our world becomes narrowed to just our family; in the case of - certain other things our world extends include other people, organizations, and ideals - ideals. Thanks to the CF.
 	Now at the age of seventeen and the oldest of seven children, she became the darling of the family. All the kids think is cool. They are tempted by the delicious snack before bed; drinks, and cakes - pastries and yogurt is always a tray full. When he needed an IV and was hospitalized for two minggum they all envy him; she had her own television in his room! He should get whatever he wants food that is directly delivered to him. He's been usual to inject herself! We made a rota to set who maintain and when, to make sure nobody who did not get visited him the elder brother. He is the king. Thanks to the CF.
 	So we were looking forward and donate for the treatment, and in the meantime, we live a normal life and fun. Every person, whether he is suffering from CF or not, should continue to march forward bearing problems and gift each - each. Sometimes - sometimes it's more of a goose step tiptoe - hopscotch. Or just with a bayonet, or the need to rely on a friend - a friend. We push ourselves to the direction of the current; we see others that way today. Thanks to the CF.</a>

                            6. Valentine's DayOne evening in February, Grandpa Grizzly came to visit. He shook the snow off his fur coat and sat by the fire.“A story, a story! Tell us a story!” cried the Hoppers. “Come sit before me,” said Grandpa Grizzly. “Do you know what holiday is coming?”The Hoppers sat and thought. What day was coming?“Don’t you know what comes on the fourteenth of February?” asked Grandpa Grizzly. The Hoppers thought as hard as they could. They could not remember.“Perhaps there is a surprise in my suitcase to help you remember. Do you have any idea?” asked Grandpa Grizzly.“No, no, we haven’t!” the Hoppers cried.“Then I’m afraid you must wait until tomorrow morning before you get your surprise. Do not sleep late!”The Hoppers laughed and promised to wake up early. They wondered all night what the surprise might be—all except Snubby Nose. He remembered what day was coming. He slept soundly the whole night.Speedy Legs, Fluffy Tail, and Floppy Ears woke up early the next morning. They went on tiptoe intoGrandpa Grizzly’s room and woke him up.“Open the suitcase, and see your surprises,” Grandpa Grizzly said.Speedy Legs looked inside and found a little bow and arrow. Fluffy Tail looked inside and found a little pair of wings. Floppy Ears took out a big box of chocolates. These all came from Cupid, because, of course, it was Valentine’s Day.“Valentine’s Day!” the Hoppers cried. But there was no Snubby Nose to find his present.“Where is Snubby Nose?” asked Grandpa Grizzly.They looked everywhere, but Snubby Nose was gone. They ate their breakfasts, and still Snubby Nose did not come. They ate their lunches, and still Snubby Nose did not come.“Open the suitcase, and see your surprises,” Grandpa Grizzly said. Speedy Legs looked inside and found a little bow and arrow. Fluffy Tail looked inside and found a little pair of wings. Floppy Ears took out a big box of chocolates. These all came from Cupid, because, of course, it was Valentine’s Day. “Valentine’s Day!” the Hoppers cried. But there was no Snubby Nose to find his present.“Where is Snubby Nose?” asked Grandpa Grizzly.They looked everywhere, but Snubby Nose was gone. They ate their breakfasts, and still Snubby Nose did not come. They ate their lunches, and still Snubby Nose did not come.Finally, Mother Hopper said, “We should go to town and look for Snubby Nose.”Grandpa Grizzly waited by the fire, in case Snubby Nose came home. The Hoppers took their wings and their chocolates and their bow and arrows and marched down the road. They were a great sight!Soon, they heard the patter of little feet running toward them. Snubby Nose came around the corner. He had a red paper heart under his arm. “I remember what comes on the fourteenth of February! It is Valentine’s Day. I made a valentine for Grandpa Grizzly.”All this time, Grandpa Grizzly waited at home. “While the Hoppers are out, I’ll make them some valentine cookies,” he said.He made some lovely cookies. He cut them in the shape of hearts and sprinkled red sugar on them. Just as he took the last pan from the oven, Snubby Nose rushed in.“The fourteenth of February is Valentine’s Day!” he said. “And I have made you a valentine.” Grandpa Grizzly was very pleased. He opened Snubby Nose’s valentine and read it to the Hoppers. “Please accept this heart of mine. I am your loving valentine.” Grandpa Grizzly was so pleased, he gave Snubby Nose the largest cookie of all.Question: What is about?

Chicken Soup For The Soul

thanks to CF
Attitude is a little thing that will lead to major changes.
-Winston Churchill -
 	One call to the panic of the first when the young doctor told us that the baby male - our new nine month old suffering from cystic fibrosis is, "Oh God, my baby will die." Indeed, that's all I could think about for days - day and weeks - weeks (maybe even months - months) first unclear. My baby will not survive. My baby will not survive. My baby ....
 	And then he became not a baby anymore. He has become like any other toddler. He shouted "No, no, no" with all his strength. He swallowed his apple sauce already mixed with the medicine. He watched Little Bear of the DVD during therapy sessions three times a day (patting his chest and then re-emit thick sputum for cough - cough). He ran from me while naked and pee on the floor. He sometimes - sometimes had to be hospitalized and intravenously. He's adorable. He was naughty. He did need extra care to stay healthy, but certainly he will not survive.
 	Repeatedly in the hospital for many - years must hinder the development - developments in the growth mentioned by experts to scare - scare inexperienced parents; They also mentioned the importance of a variety of other developments, which are much more complex to achieve child in size - the size except the things - important things for a pleasant life. My son is already manifest desire to run, who cares about when it's time? He was also a fighter and powerful. He also obtained his black belt, memangnya important to me when a child - another kid got it early? Achievement - indeed overdue achievement than children - other children, but he kept trying. He was able to play his cards well, as we all do. I must admit that the parents of children - children who get chronic diseases feeling - a feeling of excessive pride and shame for the victory - kemenanangan child. They are much sweeter. Higher value. Achievement, I think, should be measured as well in terms of depth and height. Thanks to the CF.
 	Slowly - land, after many - years, how - our view is changing.
 	Sessions - therapy sessions lungs - lungs, which originally was pleasan burdensome, has now formed a closeness between us that was until now. High nutritional standards, which once seemed as stress, has forced me to do some research and hone skills kulinerku. Logistics deadlock due to enter hospital, which originally was confusing has created a certain level of comfort in such situations. Anxiety - anxiety that is inevitable, such as depression, requires us to discuss the topic - the topic that weight. With this wisdom appreciate the variety of our family so much more alive, ranging from cooking better and stronger body to the conversation more excited and more relaxed lifestyle. We have children - other children and more to spend on ice cream. We dig deeper faith, seek - find strength and find purpose, and comfort more meaningful. Are we becoming more grieving? Certainly. However, we become wiser and more understanding. Thanks to the CF.
 	Are we becoming more grieving? Certainly. However, we become wiser and more understanding. Thanks to the CF.
 	What does it mean we just run the wisdom and everything was sorted out by itself? We wrote a letter - a letter to appeal for research funding; we work as a volunteer in various fund-raising events; we also signed and follow the demo studies and surveys; and we talk in public. There we know more and some that we know a little more. In certain cases, our world becomes narrowed to just our family; in the case of - certain other things our world extends include other people, organizations, and ideals - ideals. Thanks to the CF.
 	Now at the age of seventeen and the oldest of seven children, she became the darling of the family. All the kids think is cool. They are tempted by the delicious snack before bed; drinks, and cakes - pastries and yogurt is always a tray full. When he needed an IV and was hospitalized for two minggum they all envy him; she had her own television in his room! He should get whatever he wants food that is directly delivered to him. He's been usual to inject herself! We made a rota to set who maintain and when, to make sure nobody who did not get visited him the elder brother. He is the king. Thanks to the CF.
 	So we were looking forward and donate for the treatment, and in the meantime, we live a normal life and fun. Every person, whether he is suffering from CF or not, should continue to march forward bearing problems and gift each - each. Sometimes - sometimes it's more of a goose step tiptoe - hopscotch. Or just with a bayonet, or the need to rely on a friend - a friend. We push ourselves to the direction of the current; we see others that way today. Thanks to the CF.</h2><br />
