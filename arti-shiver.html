Then, we decided to swiminstead. We went upward to the deeper water.When we arrived, many people were alreadyswimming there. My brother looked for a shady spot toput our things. I changed my clothes and dived into thewater. What a shock 1 had! I started to shiver almostimmediately. The water was freezing.Then, my brother challenged me to a race to atherside.

                                            A young and very beautiful princess lost herball in the water while she was playing by the sideof a lake. She began to cry so sadly that the frogwho sat beside the lake croaked to her, "What willyou give me if I get you your ball back?""All the gold you could wish for!" said theprincess. "No, I ask only I'll be allowed to staywith you and be your friend," said the frog. Theprincess gave her word (what did such a promisecost her if it meant she could have her ball back?)But she had absolutely no intention of keeping herpromise. In fact, the moment she sad her ball backshe ran off so fast that the frog could not keepup with her. Nevertheless, after a while the frogarrived at the palace.As soon as she saw the frog, the princesswas frightened. She ran to ask for help from herfather, but the king, who knew what had happened,ordered his daughter to keep her promise. So theprincess picked the frog up gently in her hand,but, with a shiver of disgust, she let it drop to theground again. But that one brief touch was enoughto break the spell that bound the frog, and causedit to turn back into a young and handsome princehe had been before.​</a>

                                            PREDIKSI SOAL TES UM UGM 2016     We often think it very funny if a film shows a women or a girl screaming and running in fight at the sight of a mouse or cockroach. But we don’t consider our own little, secret fears a laughing matter. Perhaps you shiver at the sight of snake or an eel, cannot bear to hear the sound of jagged metal rubbing against metal, or feel uneasy in a lift. Fortunately, most of us suffer only a mild from of fright about certain things. According to psychiatrists, this is quite normal.
It becomes a problem only when the fear develops into mental condition that affects all aspects of person’s life. Studies of thousands of people with an abnormal dread show that every time they think about - or come into contact with - the subject of their fear, they show all the physical signs of a person who is facing serious danger : a racing heart, dry mouth, cold sweat, and weak knees.
Doctor and psychiatrists welcome publicity about phobias, for this help to convince their patients that their fears are not unique. It reassures the patients to know that there are other people who are afraid of the same thing, and it makes the patients more willing to try to understand what is causing their fear. Once they realize what in their subconscious is causing their fear, they are half-way to being cured. Psychiatrist believe that these unreasonable fears are caused by deep-seated reasons, perhaps a terrifying experience during childhood.
One typical case was Mrs. Mary Bachelor, a London housewife who suffered from agoraphobia (fears of open spaces). For twenty-three years, she remains indoors. Following publicity about other agoraphobia cases, she was persuaded to go out for the first time to watch her son perform with a pop group.
Most of us suffer from claustrophobia (fear of being in closed areas) in mild way, but the real sufferers go about in great fear of being trapped without escape in a lift, in a packed train or in an aircraft. Altogether, there are a hundred and thirty phobias listed in the medical dictionary, ranging from acrophobia (fear of heights) to xenophobia (morbid dislike of foreigner). Some phobias are very odd indeed, There are cases of people who turn cold with terror at the sight of a cabbage leaf, run away in fright at the sight of a bird or faint when they hear a dog bark. There was even a man who refused to eat anything that he knew had been touched by someone who had handled matches.

She began to cry so sadly that the frog who sat beside the lake croaked to her, “What will you giveme if I get you your ball back?”“All the gold you could wish for!” replied the princess. “No, I ask only that I am allowed to stay with you and be your friend,” said the frog. The prin­cess gave her word (what did such a promise cost herif it meant she could have her ball back?), but she had absolutely no intention of keeping her promise. In fact, the moment she had her ball back she ran off so fast that the frog could not keep up with her. Nevertheless, after a while the frog arrived at the palace.As soon as she saw the frog, the princess was frightened. She ran to ask for help from her father, but the king,who knew what had happened,ordered his daughter to keep herpromise. So the princess picked the frog up gently in her hand, but, with a shiver of disgust, she let it drop to the ground again. But that one brief touch was enough to break the spell that bound that frog, and caused it to turn back into the young and hand­some prince he had been before.The story ends with the happiest of wedding ceremonies.tentukan seting ,plot, conflic internal and eksternal , character , Point of view and theme</a>

                                            tolong kerjakan  in this modern era, there are still some parents who are reluctant about sending their daughters to college.the narrow attitude shown to women's education is largely due to the traditional role of women in society.A woman is expected to be a wife and a mother.most parents believe that if their daughter gets married and chooses to be a housewife, then the higher education will be a waste.however, an educated woman is not only a better wife but also contributes something to the society.  nowadays, more and more women are successfully combining their career and marriage.educated women are richer both emotionally and financially.they are able to find an outlet for their monotonous drudgery of their housekeeping.they bring more satisfaction and contentment to their lives.  Depriving girls of higher education is crass discrimination.times have changed;modern society needs the talent of  its people regardless of gender.today, women work alongside men.in fact, in the last few decades, women have made outstanding contributions to society. Women should be given the freedom to be educated whether or not they get married or go to work after finishing their aducations, because it is only through education that a woman will find herself useful and discover what she wants in life. A woman who works is not an insult to her husband conversely, her hunsband should feel proud of her achievements since marriage is actually an equal partnership.  Therefore, parents should not think the girls should receive less education just because they will get married one day.pertanyaan1. what is the purpose of the text above?2. what is the write's argument about higher education for women?3. how many arguments are stated in the text?4. what is meant by the writer in his recommendation?5.

                                            PREDIKSI SOAL TES UM UGM 2016     We often think it very funny if a film shows a women or a girl screaming and running in fight at the sight of a mouse or cockroach. But we don’t consider our own little, secret fears a laughing matter. Perhaps you shiver at the sight of snake or an eel, cannot bear to hear the sound of jagged metal rubbing against metal, or feel uneasy in a lift. Fortunately, most of us suffer only a mild from of fright about certain things. According to psychiatrists, this is quite normal.
It becomes a problem only when the fear develops into mental condition that affects all aspects of person’s life. Studies of thousands of people with an abnormal dread show that every time they think about - or come into contact with - the subject of their fear, they show all the physical signs of a person who is facing serious danger : a racing heart, dry mouth, cold sweat, and weak knees.
Doctor and psychiatrists welcome publicity about phobias, for this help to convince their patients that their fears are not unique. It reassures the patients to know that there are other people who are afraid of the same thing, and it makes the patients more willing to try to understand what is causing their fear. Once they realize what in their subconscious is causing their fear, they are half-way to being cured. Psychiatrist believe that these unreasonable fears are caused by deep-seated reasons, perhaps a terrifying experience during childhood.
One typical case was Mrs. Mary Bachelor, a London housewife who suffered from agoraphobia (fears of open spaces). For twenty-three years, she remains indoors. Following publicity about other agoraphobia cases, she was persuaded to go out for the first time to watch her son perform with a pop group.
Most of us suffer from claustrophobia (fear of being in closed areas) in mild way, but the real sufferers go about in great fear of being trapped without escape in a lift, in a packed train or in an aircraft. Altogether, there are a hundred and thirty phobias listed in the medical dictionary, ranging from acrophobia (fear of heights) to xenophobia (morbid dislike of foreigner). Some phobias are very odd indeed, There are cases of people who turn cold with terror at the sight of a cabbage leaf, run away in fright at the sight of a bird or faint when they hear a dog bark. There was even a man who refused to eat anything that he knew had been touched by someone who had handled matches.    “deep-seated reason” (line ...) most likely means reasons that are___ A. Long forgotten
B. Difficult to choose
C. Not easy to handle
D. Difficult to realize
E. Flexible to charge</a>

"No, I ask only I'll be allowed to staywith you and be your friend," said the frog. Theprincess gave her word (what did such a promisecost her if it meant she could have her ball back?)But she had absolutely no intention of keeping herpromise.

                            15. PREDIKSI SOAL TES UM UGM 2016     We often think it very funny if a film shows a women or a girl screaming and running in fight at the sight of a mouse or cockroach. But we don’t consider our own little, secret fears a laughing matter. Perhaps you shiver at the sight of snake or an eel, cannot bear to hear the sound of jagged metal rubbing against metal, or feel uneasy in a lift. Fortunately, most of us suffer only a mild from of fright about certain things. According to psychiatrists, this is quite normal.
It becomes a problem only when the fear develops into mental condition that affects all aspects of person’s life. Studies of thousands of people with an abnormal dread show that every time they think about - or come into contact with - the subject of their fear, they show all the physical signs of a person who is facing serious danger : a racing heart, dry mouth, cold sweat, and weak knees.
Doctor and psychiatrists welcome publicity about phobias, for this help to convince their patients that their fears are not unique. It reassures the patients to know that there are other people who are afraid of the same thing, and it makes the patients more willing to try to understand what is causing their fear. Once they realize what in their subconscious is causing their fear, they are half-way to being cured. Psychiatrist believe that these unreasonable fears are caused by deep-seated reasons, perhaps a terrifying experience during childhood.
One typical case was Mrs. Mary Bachelor, a London housewife who suffered from agoraphobia (fears of open spaces). For twenty-three years, she remains indoors. Following publicity about other agoraphobia cases, she was persuaded to go out for the first time to watch her son perform with a pop group.
Most of us suffer from claustrophobia (fear of being in closed areas) in mild way, but the real sufferers go about in great fear of being trapped without escape in a lift, in a packed train or in an aircraft. Altogether, there are a hundred and thirty phobias listed in the medical dictionary, ranging from acrophobia (fear of heights) to xenophobia (morbid dislike of foreigner). Some phobias are very odd indeed, There are cases of people who turn cold with terror at the sight of a cabbage leaf, run away in fright at the sight of a bird or faint when they hear a dog bark. There was even a man who refused to eat anything that he knew had been touched by someone who had handled matches.

                            17.   the frog princeA young and very beautiful princesslost her ball in the water, while she was playing by the side of a lake. She began to cry so sadly that the frog who sat beside the lake croaked to her, “What will you giveme if I get you your ball back?”“All the gold you could wish for!” replied the princess. “No, I ask only that I am allowed to stay with you and be your friend,” said the frog. The prin­cess gave her word (what did such a promise cost herif it meant she could have her ball back?), but she had absolutely no intention of keeping her promise. In fact, the moment she had her ball back she ran off so fast that the frog could not keep up with her. Nevertheless, after a while the frog arrived at the palace.As soon as she saw the frog, the princess was frightened. She ran to ask for help from her father, but the king,who knew what had happened,ordered his daughter to keep herpromise. So the princess picked the frog up gently in her hand, but, with a shiver of disgust, she let it drop to the ground again. But that one brief touch was enough to break the spell that bound that frog, and caused it to turn back into the young and hand­some prince he had been before.The story ends with the happiest of wedding ceremonies.tentukan seting ,plot, conflic internal and eksternal , character , Point of view and theme</h2><br />

                            20. PREDIKSI SOAL TES UM UGM 2016     We often think it very funny if a film shows a women or a girl screaming and running in fight at the sight of a mouse or cockroach. But we don’t consider our own little, secret fears a laughing matter. Perhaps you shiver at the sight of snake or an eel, cannot bear to hear the sound of jagged metal rubbing against metal, or feel uneasy in a lift. Fortunately, most of us suffer only a mild from of fright about certain things. According to psychiatrists, this is quite normal.
It becomes a problem only when the fear develops into mental condition that affects all aspects of person’s life. Studies of thousands of people with an abnormal dread show that every time they think about - or come into contact with - the subject of their fear, they show all the physical signs of a person who is facing serious danger : a racing heart, dry mouth, cold sweat, and weak knees.
Doctor and psychiatrists welcome publicity about phobias, for this help to convince their patients that their fears are not unique. It reassures the patients to know that there are other people who are afraid of the same thing, and it makes the patients more willing to try to understand what is causing their fear. Once they realize what in their subconscious is causing their fear, they are half-way to being cured. Psychiatrist believe that these unreasonable fears are caused by deep-seated reasons, perhaps a terrifying experience during childhood.
One typical case was Mrs. Mary Bachelor, a London housewife who suffered from agoraphobia (fears of open spaces). For twenty-three years, she remains indoors. Following publicity about other agoraphobia cases, she was persuaded to go out for the first time to watch her son perform with a pop group.
Most of us suffer from claustrophobia (fear of being in closed areas) in mild way, but the real sufferers go about in great fear of being trapped without escape in a lift, in a packed train or in an aircraft. Altogether, there are a hundred and thirty phobias listed in the medical dictionary, ranging from acrophobia (fear of heights) to xenophobia (morbid dislike of foreigner). Some phobias are very odd indeed, There are cases of people who turn cold with terror at the sight of a cabbage leaf, run away in fright at the sight of a bird or faint when they hear a dog bark. There was even a man who refused to eat anything that he knew had been touched by someone who had handled matches.    To cure their phobias, patients___
A. Should take their unusual fear seriously
B. May have to consider publicity of their fears
C. Determine the dangers caused by their phobias D. Try to convince their doctors of their secret fears E. Try to understand the real cause of their phobias</h2><br />

Depriving girls of higher education is crass discrimination.times have changed;modern society needs the talent of  its people regardless of gender.today, women work alongside men.in fact, in the last few decades, women have made outstanding contributions to society. Women should be given the freedom to be educated whether or not they get married or go to work after finishing their aducations, because it is only through education that a woman will find herself useful and discover what she wants in life. A woman who works is not an insult to her husband conversely, her hunsband should feel proud of her achievements since marriage is actually an equal partnership.  Therefore, parents should not think the girls should receive less education just because they will get married one day.pertanyaan1. what is the purpose of the text above?2. what is the write's argument about higher education for women?3. how many arguments are stated in the text?4. what is meant by the writer in his recommendation?5.

                            26. PREDIKSI SOAL TES UM UGM 2016     We often think it very funny if a film shows a women or a girl screaming and running in fight at the sight of a mouse or cockroach. But we don’t consider our own little, secret fears a laughing matter. Perhaps you shiver at the sight of snake or an eel, cannot bear to hear the sound of jagged metal rubbing against metal, or feel uneasy in a lift. Fortunately, most of us suffer only a mild from of fright about certain things. According to psychiatrists, this is quite normal.
It becomes a problem only when the fear develops into mental condition that affects all aspects of person’s life. Studies of thousands of people with an abnormal dread show that every time they think about - or come into contact with - the subject of their fear, they show all the physical signs of a person who is facing serious danger : a racing heart, dry mouth, cold sweat, and weak knees.
Doctor and psychiatrists welcome publicity about phobias, for this help to convince their patients that their fears are not unique. It reassures the patients to know that there are other people who are afraid of the same thing, and it makes the patients more willing to try to understand what is causing their fear. Once they realize what in their subconscious is causing their fear, they are half-way to being cured. Psychiatrist believe that these unreasonable fears are caused by deep-seated reasons, perhaps a terrifying experience during childhood.
One typical case was Mrs. Mary Bachelor, a London housewife who suffered from agoraphobia (fears of open spaces). For twenty-three years, she remains indoors. Following publicity about other agoraphobia cases, she was persuaded to go out for the first time to watch her son perform with a pop group.
Most of us suffer from claustrophobia (fear of being in closed areas) in mild way, but the real sufferers go about in great fear of being trapped without escape in a lift, in a packed train or in an aircraft. Altogether, there are a hundred and thirty phobias listed in the medical dictionary, ranging from acrophobia (fear of heights) to xenophobia (morbid dislike of foreigner). Some phobias are very odd indeed, There are cases of people who turn cold with terror at the sight of a cabbage leaf, run away in fright at the sight of a bird or faint when they hear a dog bark. There was even a man who refused to eat anything that he knew had been touched by someone who had handled matches.    “deep-seated reason” (line ...) most likely means reasons that are___ A. Long forgotten
B. Difficult to choose
C. Not easy to handle
D. Difficult to realize
E. Flexible to charge</h2><br />
                        C. Not easy to handle<br />-&gt; Deep-seated adalah frase Bahasa Inggris yang artinya "mendalam/di tingkat yang dalam".<br /><br />-&gt; Unreasonable fears are caused by deep-seated reason, which is <strong>not easy to handle</strong> because it's already firmly planted in the sufferer's mind.<br />Penjelasan dari jawaban ini terdapat pada paragraf kedua kalimat pertama.<br />Di paragraf tersebut dijelaskan bahwa ketakutan yang berkembang sehingga memengaruhi kondisi mental akan berpengaruh juga terhadap kehidupan sosial seseorang.<br />Jika ketakutannya telah berakibat buruk terhadap kehidupannya, maka rasa takutnya tersebut akan sulit untuk diatasi (not easy to handle).<br /><br /><strong>Jawaban: C</strong><br />
